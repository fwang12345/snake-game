# Snake Game

Snake Game is a game in which a green snake, initially of length 1, grows by eating food, which is denoted by white circles. The snake may change 
direction using direction keys "w", "a", "s", and "d". The game keeps track of the top 10 high scores in a file called highScores.txt which should 
not be edited.
